<h2> About me...</h2>

<p align="left">
 👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate professional with over two years of experience in data analysis and backend development, always seeking ways to innovate and optimize.

🌱 My journey: I started learning about data in 2021 with personal projects, and since then, I’ve rapidly grown. I spent two years as a Data Analyst and have recently transitioned into Backend Development.

💡 My expertise:

🔗 API development
🛠️ Advanced SQL (triggers, complex queries, functions)
📊 Tools: Google Sheets, Looker, Databricks
🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
🎯 My goal: To be part of a team that doesn't just drive change, but revolutionizes the industry.

⚡ What sets me apart: I’m a quick learner, always updating my skills, and I excel at adapting to new challenges. I’m constantly looking for the most efficient ways to do things and love working in fast-paced environments.</p>
